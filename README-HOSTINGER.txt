CODEX DYNAMICS - HOSTINGER 1-CLICK DEPLOYMENT PACKAGE
=======================================================

HOW TO DEPLOY ON HOSTINGER (takes under 60 seconds):
1. Log in to your Hostinger hPanel (https://hpanel.hostinger.com).
2. Go to "Websites" -> Click "Manage" on your website.
3. Open "File Manager" -> Navigate to the "public_html" directory.
4. Upload this ZIP file ("hostinger-public_html.zip") directly into public_html.
5. Right-click the ZIP file and choose "Extract".
   (Extract directly into public_html, so index.html, .htaccess, assets/ and api/ sit in public_html).
6. That's it! Your website is 100% live immediately.

WHAT IS INCLUDED & WORKING:
- Complete High-Performance Frontend (React 19 + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion)
- Apache .htaccess configured for Single Page Application (SPA) routing
- Full PHP SQLite Backend in /api/:
    * /api/crm-action.php (CRM operations, blog/project/review management, image uploads)

    * /api/public/content.php (Live website projects, client reviews, published blogs)
    * /api/track-visitor.php (Real-time visitor tracking, IP geolocation & activity)
    * /api/submit-enquiry.php & send-mail.php (Contact forms with SMTP & mail fallback)
- Pre-seeded SQLite Database:
    * Pre-populated with your projects, categories, uploaded media, client reviews, and blogs.
    * Database is secured by .htaccess so visitors cannot download the raw .sqlite file.

    * URL: https://yourdomain.com/admin
    * Default Email: admin@codexdynamics.com
    * Default Password: Admin123!
    (You can change your password anytime in the Admin CRM -> Settings tab)
